Specification:
" Microsoft set us the challenge of learning about Quantum Computing, 
bringing our ideas to the table, and then testing their recently 
released Quantum Computing Development Kit. "

Description:
This development kit includes what a developer would need to get 
started in the field: a Q# language and compiler along with a Q# library, 
a local quantum computing simulator, and a Visual Studio extension. The 
aim is to test whether with the lack of hardware, the software provided 
accurately simulates how a quantum computer would work.

The main objective is to decide whether the tool released adequately 
simulates how a quantum computer would work (as true quantum computers 
are still in their infancy).

Our Challenge:
Learn the concepts of Quantum Computing
Learn to use the Quantum Development kit
    Learn Q#
    Run Simple Programs
    Create and run our own program

Project Deliverables:
Triangle Finding algorithm code - this will be an implementation of the 
    algorithm in Q#. It will be executable using the Microsoft Quantum 
    Development Kit.
User Interface - a simple way to 
    1) input the graph the user wants to test and 
    2) view the results of the processing
Technical reports - this will be a description of what we have developed, 
with an overview of how it works, how to use it and analysis of our solutionâ€™s 
quality (ie: how does this algorithm compare to others?).

Project Timeline:
Week 1-3 : Learn concepts of Quantum Computing and brainstorm ideas
Week 4-6: Learn to use Development Kit (Q#)
Week 7: Implement traditional algorithm - Brute Force 
Week 8 : Implement Smarter Traditional Algorithm - Trace
Week 9 - 11: Implement quantum algorithm
Week 12: Comparisons, Graphs & Reports 

What we did:
1) Choose Algorithm (Triangle Finding Problem)
2) Implement Classic Algorithm (Brute Force and Trace)
3) Implement Quantum Algorithm
4) Decide on method of comparison and compare

Accompanying Documentation (Technical Reports):
1) Requirements Report
2) Development Report
3) Management Report
4) Quantum Paper (written by team about experience)

Possible Improvements:
Classical: Strassens Algorithm implemented for fast matrix multiplication
Quantum: G-BBHT search Algorithm to replace Grovers
