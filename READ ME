What we were expected to do:

Microsoft set us the challenge of learning about Quantum Computing, 
bringing our ideas to the table, and then testing their recently 
released Quantum Computing Development Kit. 

This development kit includes what a developer would need to get 
started in the field: a Q# language and compiler along with a Q# library, 
a local quantum computing simulator, and a Visual Studio extension. The 
aim is to test whether with the lack of hardware, the software provided 
accurately simulates how a quantum computer would work.

What we did:
1) Choose Algorithm (Triangle Finding Problem)
2) Implement Classic Algorithm (Brute Force and Trace)
3) Implement Quantum Algorithm
4) Decide on method of comparison and compare

Accompanying Documentation:
1) Requirements Report
2) Development Report
3) Management Report
4) Quantum Paper (written by team about experience)
